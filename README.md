# Business-contract-validation
This code is a Streamlit app that allows users to upload their own business contract or select a synthetic contract to highlight important terms and entities. The app uses a pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the contract text and highlights them along with a list of predefined keywords. The highlighted contract text is then displayed to the user.

This code generates and saves 5 synthetic business contracts to separate text files. Each contract includes randomized information such as party names, agreement terms, confidentiality clauses, liability statements, and termination conditions.
